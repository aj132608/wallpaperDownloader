Description: # Wallpaper Downloader
        ###Description
        Downloads wallpapers to a specified folder on your computer. The program uses the pyunsplash API and groups the wallpapers as collections in their own respective folders.
        #
        #How to Start
        Make sure that you have the right modules to run the program by running the setup.py
        ```
        python setup
        ```
        If there are any issues running the setup.py,
        simply run the following commands
        ```
        pip install pyunsplash
        pip install requests
        ```
        The main program grabs the API key and the root directory from a json file called package.json. 
        You will want to fill in the directory of your choice there as well as the API key that you can
        get by registering for it [here](https://unsplash.com/developers). 
        #How to Run the Program
        The whole app is executed from the wallpaperDownloader.py. You can run it by typing the following command.
        ```
        python wallpaperDownloader.py
        ```
